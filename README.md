This is a simple Angular webapp created for the purposes of learning Angular

##Build:

You require webpack to build this application.  webpack-dev-server is also convenient for hosting the app.
If it is not already installed, run:

> npm i -g webpack

> npm i -g webpack-dev-server

Next you need to install all of the projects dependencies.  This can be done with:

> npm i

With all of the dependencies resolved, you can build the application with:

> webpack

To simply serve the application run:

> webpack-dev-server

You should now be able to view the app at [localhost:8080](localhost:8080)
